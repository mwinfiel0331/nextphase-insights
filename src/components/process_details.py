        ### Process Documentation
        In this section, we'll document each business process you'd like to optimize. 
        Please document one process at a time, breaking down all the steps involved.
        
        **Example Process: Invoice Processing**
        1. Receive invoice via email
        2. Extract invoice data (dates, amounts, vendor info)
        3. Match invoice to purchase order
        4. Validate line items and amounts
        5. Route for department approval
        6. Obtain finance director sign-off if over $5000
        7. Enter into accounting system
        8. Schedule payment based on terms
        9. Process payment via banking system
        10. Update vendor records
        11. File documentation for audit
        
        Think about similar end-to-end processes in your organization that could benefit from automation.
